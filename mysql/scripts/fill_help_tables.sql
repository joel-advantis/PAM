For example, if the password to connect to your MySQL master has\nchanged, you just need to issue these statements\nto tell the slave about the new password:\n\nmysql> STOP SLAVE; -- if replication was running\nmysql> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_PASSWORD='new3cret';\nmysql> START SLAVE; -- if you want to restart replication\n\nThere is no need to specify the parameters that do\nnot change (host, port, user, and so forth).\n\nMASTER_HOST and MASTER_PORT are the hostname (or IP address) of\nthe master host and its TCP/IP port. Note that if MASTER_HOST is\nequal to localhost, then, like in other parts of MySQL, the port\nmay be ignored (if Unix socket files can be used, for example).\n\nIf you specify MASTER_HOST or MASTER_PORT,\nthe slave assumes that the master server is different than\nbefore (even if you specify a host or port value that is\nthe same as the current value.) In this case, the old values for the master\nbinary log name and position are considered no longer applicable, so if you\ndo not specify MASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS in the\nstatement, MASTER_LOG_FILE='' and MASTER_LOG_POS=4 are\nsilently appended to it. \n\nMASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS are the coordinates\nat which the slave I/O thread should begin reading from the master the\nnext time the thread starts.\nIf you specify either of them, you can't specify RELAY_LOG_FILE or\nRELAY_LOG_POS.\nIf neither of MASTER_LOG_FILE or MASTER_LOG_POS are\nspecified, the slave uses the last coordinates of the /slave SQL thread/\nbefore CHANGE MASTER was issued. This ensures that\nreplication has no discontinuity, even if the slave SQL thread was late\ncompared to the slave I/O thread, when you just want to change, say, the\npassword to use. This safe behavior was introduced starting from MySQL\n4.0.17 and 4.1.1. (Before these versions, the coordinates used were \nthe last coordinates of the slave I/O thread before CHANGE MASTER\nwas issued. This caused the SQL thread to possibly lose some events\nfrom the master, thus breaking replication.)\n\nCHANGE MASTER /deletes all relay log files/ and starts\na new one, unless you specify RELAY_LOG_FILE or\nRELAY_LOG_POS. In that case, relay logs are kept;\nas of MySQL 4.1.1 the relay_log_purge global variable\nis set silently to 0.\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO updates the contents of the *master.info and\n*relay-log.info files.\n\nCHANGE MASTER is useful for setting up a slave when you have\nthe snapshot of the master and have recorded the log and the offset\ncorresponding to it.  After loading the snapshot into the slave, you\ncan run CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='log_name_on_master',\nMASTER_LOG_POS=log_offset_on_master on the slave.\n\nExamples:\n\nmysql> CHANGE MASTER TO\n    ->     MASTER_HOST='master2.mycompany.com',\n    ->     MASTER_USER='replication',\n    ->     MASTER_PASSWORD='bigs3cret',\n    ->     MASTER_PORT=3306,\n    ->     MASTER_LOG_FILE='master2-bin.001',\n    ->     MASTER_LOG_POS=4,\n    ->     MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=10;\n\nmysql> CHANGE MASTER TO\n    ->     RELAY_LOG_FILE='slave-relay-bin.006',\n    ->     RELAY_LOG_POS=4025;\n",""),(144,28,"DROP DATABASE","DROP DATABASE drops all tables in the database and deletes the\ndatabase.
