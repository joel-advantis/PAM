Parameter



AVAILABILITY Application Class
Alerts

Shows the severity of the most recent Oracle error that was written to the alert log for this instance. Alarm means an Oracle error in the 00600–00639 range was found in the alert log; warning means that an Oracle error with the filter you specified has been found.

The annotation displays the most recent ORA errors detected in the last polling cycle, and any error log filters that have been specified.
ArchFreeSpace

If the automated recovery actions have been set, that action will be taken when this parameter goes into alarm. The annotation displays the destination device, the space used and the space left on the device.

This parameter is not active for a remote instance and is not online if operating system components are not running. If the archive mode of the database is set to none, ArchFreeSpace is not active.

If there is more than one archive log destination whose BINDING is MANDATORY, ArchFreeSpace is inactive, and a blank destination may appear in the Archiving State report.

Collector: CollAvailability

Parameter



Detail Application Class
Delta_Bytes_Processed

Displays the number of bytes that PATROL WDO processed for Web transactions since the last PATROL collector cycle. This value includes traffic for objects that were compressed, uncompressed, and excluded by the administrator.

EligibleTrafficCompressedPct

Reports the percent by which only the eligible objects were compressed. PATROL WDO compresses HTML, Javascript, Java applets, XML, Microsoft Word documents, PowerPoint documents, and Microsoft Excel documents.

PATROL WDO determines the percentage of Eligible Compression by dividing the number of bytes by which the eligible objects were compressed by the total number of bytes for the eligible objects. For example, the eligible objects have 2500 bytes. These objects were reduced by 2000 bytes to 500 bytes. Divide 2000 bytes by 2500 bytes, and the eligible objects were compressed by 80%.

Collector: WDO_Collector

Reports the percent by which the all of the objects were compressed, ineligible and eligible, since the last PATROL WDO reset or server reboot.

Total Compression is based on the Eligible Compression number.

PATROL WDO determines the percentage of Total Compression by dividing the number of bytes by which the eligible objects were compressed by the total number of bytes for all of the objects; eligible and ineligible. For example the total objects have 7500 bytes. Of that, the eligible objects have 2500 bytes. The eligible objects were reduced by 2000 bytes to 500 bytes. Divide 2000 bytes by 7500 bytes, and the total objects were compressed by 27%.
